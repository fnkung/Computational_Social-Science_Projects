    "Finally, there are many states accounted for the in dataset. If we convert this column to a categorical variable, and create dummies, it will create a rather sparse matrix (many 0s in our dataset) becuase there will be 49 dummy variables. One alternative is to classify each state to a larger US region and use that variable instead of state. The following code will do that."

    "The barplot below explores how race and ethnicity varies across region. I focus on the larger racial / ethnic groups of white, Black, Asian and Hispanic/Latino for simplicity, including the single race categories. The mixed race population is a very small percentage of the population (2% as given below), but its interesting to see that the max is far higher. White here excludes those who are white and who also identify as Hispanic or Latino."

    "OLS (ordinary least squares) is a linear regression model which finds a best fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. It assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. Other assumptions are that the error term / residual is normally distributed, and also that the independent variables are not multicollinear, not perfectly correleated with each other. The pros is that it is simple and its easy to understand and interpret the coefficients. However the cons is its prone to overfitting, especially when there are a lot of independent variables. I have dropped a lot of features from the intial data set, going from over 90 variables to 22, so it is worth trying to use OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge is also a linear regression model. It addresses the overfitting problem of OLS by penalizing large coefficients and shrinking them towards zero. A pro is that this can help with overfitting because it reduces variance, and another pro is this can help select important features and unselect irrelevant features. Its worth trying to reduce overfitting, and also because from the data exploration, its not as clear if things like age or sex impact diabetes, therefore Ridge could help to select important features. \n",
    "\n",
    "K nearest neighbors (KNN) is a model that take a data point and its K nearest neighbors, K data points that are similar to the data point, and then predict the output for the data point based on the output of its K nearest neighbors. The idea is that similar data points would have similar outputs. This model can work for nonlinear relationships. Other advantages is that it is robust to outliers, and is easier to interpret. However, it takes a lot of computing resources. The idea that similar neighbors, people with similar demographics or lifestyles, might have similar tendency to have / not have diabetes means that KNN could be a useful predicitive model. When I did the data exploration and the box and whisker plots, there were also definitely outliers when it came to high values of diabetes number, so KNN can also be helpful."
