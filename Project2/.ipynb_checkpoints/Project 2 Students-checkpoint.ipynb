If we convert this column to a categorical variable, and create dummies, it will create a rather sparse matrix (many 0s in our dataset) becuase there will be 49 dummy variables. One alternative is to classify each state to a larger US region and use that variable instead of state. The following code will do that."

    "This barplot explores how race and ethnicity varies across region. I focus on the larger racial / ethnic groups of white, Black, Asian and Hispanic/Latino for simplicity, including the single race categories, as the mixed race population is a very small percentage of the population. White here excludes those who are white and who also identify as Hispanic or Latino."
